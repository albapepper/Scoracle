    # Introduction
    API-SPORTS widgets allow you to easily display **dynamic sports data** on your website.

    They are designed to be:

    - **Ultra-modular**: each component is autonomous
    - **Customisable**: language, theme, content, behaviour
    - **Easy to integrate**: no framework required, a simple HTML tag is all you need

    They use request from your API-SPORTS account and work with **all plans**, including the free plan.  

    ## Security
    Our widgets use your account's API-KEY, which must be specified in the `data-key` attribute of your widget configuration.

    When using these widgets it is important to be aware that your API-KEY will be visible to the users of your site, it is possible to protect yourself from this by allowing only the desired domains or IP in our [dashboard](https://dashboard.api-football.com/profile?access).
    This way no one else can use your API-KEY for you. If you have already set up your widget and have not activated this option, you can reset your API-KEY and activate this option after.

    You can further enhance security by completely hiding your API-KEY from the source code by following this [tutorial](https://www.api-football.com/news/post/how-to-optimize-widgets-cache-and-security-tutorial).

    ## Caching Data

    By using Widgets, each visit to a page on your website triggers one or more API requests to retrieve data. Without a caching system, your daily quota can be reached very quickly.

    **Example:**
    If a page triggers a single API request per visitor and you receive 80 visits to that page in one minute, this results in **80 API requests**. Over a full day, that can add up to **115 200 requests**.

    By implementing a caching system, even with a very short duration, such as **60 seconds**, you can drastically reduce the number of requests. The first visit will trigger an API request, but the response will then be cached for the next 60 seconds. This means that if 80 visitors access the same page within that time frame, **only the first request** will reach the API, while the next 79 will be served directly from the cache.

    With this system in place, you reduce usage from **115 200** requests per day to just **1 440**.

    A full tutorial is available [here](https://www.api-football.com/news/post/how-to-optimize-widgets-cache-and-security-tutorial), explaining step by step how to set up an effective caching system.

    ## Debugging
    If the widget does not display the requested information, it is possible to set the `data-show-errors` tag to **true** to display error messages directly in the widget and in the console. This can be due to several things like : *(Non-exhaustive list)*
    - You have reached your daily number of requests
    - Tags are incorrectly filled in
    - Your API-KEY is incorrect

    ## Logos / Images

    Calls to logos/images do not count towards your daily quota and are provided for free. However these calls are subject to a **rate per second & minute**, it is recommended to save this data on your side in order not to slow down or impact the user experience of your application or website. For this you can use **CDNs** such as [bunny.net](https://bunny.net?ref=8r6al7jhm4).

    We have a tutorial available [here](https://www.api-football.com/news/post/optimizing-sports-websites-bunnycdn-api-sports-image-storage-guide), which explains how to set up your own media system with **BunnyCDN**. Once you have done this, all you need to do is to set the `data-logo-url` parameter with the URL of your CDN.

    Logos, images and trademarks delivered through the API are provided solely for identification and descriptive purposes (e.g., identifying leagues, teams, players or venues). We does not own any of these visual assets, and no intellectual property rights are claimed over them. Some images or data may be subject to intellectual property or trademark rights held by third parties (including but not limited to leagues, federations, or clubs). The use of such content in your applications, websites, or products may require additional authorization or licensing from the respective rights holders. You are fully responsible for ensuring that your usage of any logos, images, or branded content complies with applicable laws in your country or the countries where your services are made available. We are not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by any sports league, federation, or brand featured in the data provided.

    # Before You Begin
    ## Dynamic targeting
      Some widgets, such as `games`, can dynamically open other widgets like `game`, `standings`, `player`, and more.  
      This interaction is enabled using the `data-target-*` attributes.

      These attributes allow you to define **where** the opened widget should be rendered:

      - `modal` → renders the widget inside a modal.
      - CSS selector (`#id` or `.class`) → injects the widget into a specific HTML element on the page.

      These targeting options are available for:

      **General sports widgets (Football, Basketball, etc.):**

      - `data-target-game`
      - `data-target-standings`
      - `data-target-team`
      - `data-target-player`
      - `data-target-league`

      **Formula 1 specific:**

      - `data-target-race`
      - `data-target-ranking`
      - `data-target-driver`

      **MMA specific:**

      - `data-target-fight`
      - `data-target-fighter`


      **Target a container by ID**

      ```html
        <api-sports-widget data-type="games"></api-sports-widget>
        
        <div id="details"></div>

        <api-sports-widget
          data-type="config"
          data-key="Your-Api-Key-Here"
          data-sport="football"
          data-target-game="#details"
        ></api-sports-widget>
      ```
      **Target using modal**

      ```html
        <api-sports-widget data-type="games"></api-sports-widget>

        <api-sports-widget
          data-type="config"
          data-key="Your-Api-Key-Here"
          data-sport="football"
          data-target-game="modal"
        ></api-sports-widget>
      ```
    ## Language

      The `data-lang` attribute allows you to easily switch the interface language of all widgets.

      #### Available languages:

      - `en` (English)
      - `fr` (French)
      - `es` (Spanish)
      - `it` (Italian)

      **Example usage**
      ```html
      <api-sports-widget
        data-type="config"
        data-key="Your-Api-Key"
        data-sport="football"
        data-lang="en"
        data-custom-lang="https://yourdomain.com/lang/en.json"
      ></api-sports-widget>
      ```
      > Example <br><img src='https://api-sports-media-temp.b-cdn.net/widgets/lang.png'/>

      #### Custom translations:
      For complete control over wording, you can load your own translation file using `data-custom-lang`.  
      This file must be a valid JSON object following the internal key structure.

      You can download the translation file [here](https://widgets.api-sports.io/3.1.0/en.json).

      It allows you to:
      - Override specific labels
      - Translate missing terms
      - Adapt terminology to your audience

      Example JSON format:
      ```json
      {
        "all": "All",
        "live": "Now Live",
        "finished": "Completed",
        "scheduled": "Coming Up",
        "favorites": "Favorites",
      }
      ```

      > You can use `data-lang` and `data-custom-lang` **together**.  
      > If a key is defined in both, the **custom file will take priority**.

      
      **Exemple for custom translation**
      
      ```html
        <api-sports-widget data-type="games" data-target-game="modal"></api-sports-widget>

        <api-sports-widget
          data-type="config"
          data-key="Your-Api-Key-Here"
          data-sport="football"
          data-lang="custom"
          data-custom-lang="https://yourdomain.com/lang/custom.json"
        ></api-sports-widget>
      ```

      You have a tutorial available [here](https://www.api-football.com/news/post/create-a-custom-translation-file-for-your-widgets)

      ## Predefined themes
      Four built-in themes are available by default. You can set them using the `data-theme` attribute on any widget.

      - `white` (default)
      - `grey`
      - `dark`
      - `blue`

      Each theme adjusts background colors, text colors, button styles, borders, and more.

      <div style='display: flex;gap: 0.25rem;'>
        
      **White**  
      <img src='https://api-sports-media-temp.b-cdn.net/widgets/white.png'/>
      **Grey**  
      <img src='https://api-sports-media-temp.b-cdn.net/widgets/grey.png'/>

      **Dark**  
      <img src='https://api-sports-media-temp.b-cdn.net/widgets/dark.png'/>
      **Blue**  
      <img src='https://api-sports-media-temp.b-cdn.net/widgets/blue.png'/>
      </div>

      ## Custom theme
      You can override the default styles by creating your own CSS theme using the `data-theme` attribute and custom variable declarations.

      Example:

      ```css
      api-sports-widget[data-theme="MyTheme"] {
        --primary-color: #18cfc0;
        --success-color: #2ecc58;
        --warning-color: #f39c12;
        --danger-color: #e74c3c;
        --light-color: #898989;

        --home-color: var(--primary-color);
        --away-color: #ffc107;

        --text-color: #333;
        --text-color-info: #333;

        --background-color: #fff;

        --primary-font-size: 0.72rem;
        --secondary-font-size: 0.75rem;
        --button-font-size: 0.8rem;
        --title-font-size: 0.9rem;

        --header-text-transform: uppercase;
        --button-text-transform: uppercase;
        --title-text-transform: uppercase;

        --border: 1px solid #95959530;
        --game-height: 2.3rem;
        --league-height: 2.35rem;

        --score-size: 2.25rem;
        --flag-size: 22px;
        --teams-logo-size: 18px;
        --teams-logo-size-xl: 5rem;
        --hover: rgba(200, 200, 200, 0.15);
      }
      
      ```

      ```html
          <api-sports-widget data-type="games"></api-sports-widget>

          <div id="game-container"></div>

          <api-sports-widget
            data-type="config"
            data-key="Your-Api-Key-Here"
            data-sport="football"
            data-theme="MyTheme"
          ></api-sports-widget>
      ```

        - Configuration
      summary: Script & Configuration
      description: |
        #### Insert the script

        To run our widgets, you must include this JavaScript file in your HTML page.

        This script is necessary to load the web components used by all widgets *(games, player, standings, etc.)*.
        ```html
        <script type="module" src="https://widgets.api-sports.io/3.1.0/widgets.js"></script>
        ```

        #### Insert the configuration widget

        Global settings are defined with a single configuration widget `data-type="config"`

        This widget is required for our widgets to function and must be present on your HTML page.

        It initialises the general settings *(API key, sport, language, theme, etc.)* for all other widgets on your page.

        ```html
            <api-sports-widget
              data-type="config"
              data-key="Your-Api-Key-Here"
              data-sport="football"
            ></api-sports-widget>
        ```

        > The configuration widget must be included only once, and all other widgets on the page will automatically inherit these settings, unless they are redefined locally.

        Any configuration parameter that you do not add to your code will automatically take its default value.

               For example, instead of putting the "data-target-game" 
               parameter in the "games" and "league" widgets, 
               you can put it once in "config."
               This works with all parameters shared by widgets.
